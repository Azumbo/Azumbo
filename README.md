# Azumbo Retro Games

This project contains a set of small browser games built with **Next.js** and styled with a pixel inspired look.

The site loads the Google font **Press Start 2P** and uses it throughout the components to create a retro arcade theme.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Run the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the site.

## Production build

Create an optimized build with:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can then start the production server using `npm start`.

## Emoji Pac‑Man

The repository includes a simple Pac‑Man clone that lives entirely on the client. After running the development or production server, navigate to [`/emojiPacMan`](http://localhost:3000/emojiPacMan) to play the game. Controls and additional details can be found in [`public/emojiPacMan/README.md`](public/emojiPacMan/README.md).
